\chapter{Packed operation module (PM)}
\label{module:PM}

The Packed operation module adds facilities for parallel operation on packed
data types. Most instructions are extended with packed operation modes, and a
few instructions are added that mainly deal with packing and unpacking of data
of different sizes.

Both scalar registers and vector registers may be used to hold packed data
types.

\section{Packed data operation}

Many instructions are extended with the ability to operate on several
individual sub-parts of the source and destination elements. These sub-parts
are referred to as slices.

A single 32-bit element may be split up into one, two or four slices, as
follows:

\begin{bytefield}{32}
  \bitheader{0,8,16,24,31} \\
  \begin{rightwordgroup}{}
    \bitbox{32}{word}
  \end{rightwordgroup} \\
  \begin{rightwordgroup}{H}
    \bitbox{16}{half-word} &
   \bitbox{16}{half-word}
  \end{rightwordgroup} \\
  \begin{rightwordgroup}{B}
    \bitbox{8}{byte} &
    \bitbox{8}{byte} &
    \bitbox{8}{byte} &
    \bitbox{8}{byte}
  \end{rightwordgroup}
\end{bytefield}

When a packed operation is performed, all slices within a 32-bit word are
processed in parallel. It is not possible to process only a subset of the
slices.

\subsection{Word mode}

In word mode, which is the default, each element is processed as a single
32-bit slice.

\subsection{Half-word mode}

In half-word mode each element is processed as two individual 16-bit slices in
parallel.

In assembly language, half-word mode is indicated by appending the suffix .H
to the instruction mnemonic.

\subsection{Byte mode}

In byte mode each element is processed as four individual 8-bit slices in
parallel.

In assembly language, byte mode is indicated by appending the suffix .B to the
instruction mnemonic.

\subsection{Packed floating-point operation}

For floating-point instructions, using packed operating modes implies using
floating-point precisions lower than single precision:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Mode} & \textbf{Precision} \\
  \hline
  word & Single precision floating-point \\
  \hline
  half-word & Half precision floating-point \\
  \hline
  byte & Quarter precision floating-point \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
