registers:

      num: 0x0000
      name: CPU feature flags register 0
      rw: "R"
      descr: >
        Bit 0: VM (Vector operatoin module)

        Bit 1: PM (Packed operation module)

        Bit 2: FM (Floating-point module)

  MAX_VL:

      name: Maximum vector length
      rw: "R"
      descr: >
        The maximum vector length for vector operations.

        For implementations that advertise support for the Vector operation
        module (VM), the value of this register shall be a power of two, and
        at least 16.

        For implementations that do not support vector operations, the value
        of this register shall be zero (0).
