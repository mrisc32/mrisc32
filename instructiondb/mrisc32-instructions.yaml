  Integer arithmetic:

      asmOperands: "{1}, {3}, {2}"
      note: >
        The instruction actually subtracts the first source operand from the
        second source operand. However, in the assembler syntax the order of
        the source operands is reversed compared to how the operands are
        encoded in the instruction word, in order to make the assembler syntax
        more natural.

        The advantage is that it is possible to subtract a register operand
        from an immediate operand (subtracting an immediate operand from a
        register operand can be implemented with the ADD instruction, using a
        negated immediate operand).

        the first operand.

        Bit 12 of the control word determines the sign mode: 1 = sign fill,

        Bits 0-1 give the source byte index for destination byte 0, and

        destination byte 2 and bits 9-11 define destination byte 3.

        When the fill mode is 0, the source byte is copied to the destination
        byte. When the fill mode is 1, the destination byte is filled with the
        most significant bit of the source byte if the sign mode is 1, or zeros
        if the sign mode is 0.
